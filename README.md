# Open-Board
1.	PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of the project is to create a real time Drawing Application which allows various users to perform the same task on the drawing sheet simultaneously. The various major features which would be made available to the users are draw using pencil, change the thickness, colour of the pencil, eraser and its size. The other various features are adding text, image in the sheet.

2.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project is a totally development-based frontend Project. It is made by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It can be used to as a drawing tool for the users to work together on one sheet simultaneously. This feature is implemented by using sockets, The sheet can be downloaded easily in jpeg format. There is an option of zooming in and out in the Open Board and Undoing and redoing the work done. The project is hosted online on Heroku, so that the users can directly work together on the sheet remotely. The user can even add text, upload image on the sheet which would only be seen in their sheet, even if multiple users are working on one board. That helps in case when one doesn’t want everyone to see something but, at the same time wants to add one thing or the other in the sheet.

3.	SKILL AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED

•	  HTML

The Hypertext Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
•	Structuring of webpage
•	Uploading and downloading image

•	  CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
•	Style and layout web pages.

•	  JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behaviour, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
•	Dynamic and interactive web content.
•	Controlling dimension and shape of various tools,
•	Script to undo and redo the task.

4.	LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORK USED

•	  Express

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back-end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
Flexible Node.js application framework that provides a robust set of features for web application. Socket.IO is a JavaScript library and hence Express was used.

•	  Socket

Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.
•	Real time communication

•	  Canvas

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. We must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

5.	SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

Functional Requirement:

•	The user of the program can be able to draw anything online with various tools available.
•	Anything drawn can be downloaded on the device of the user.
•	Various users must be able to work on the same board simultaneously.
•	The image can be downloaded and uploaded if required.

Non-Functional Requirement:

•	The data representation in the OpenBoard must be organized and clean.
•	The download time of the sheet of the drawing must be the least.
•	The time lag between action and reaction of it on the screen must be as minimal as possible.
•	There can be scope of adding more features to the OpenBoard.
•	For multiple users working on the same board, the time lag should be minimum.

6.	FUTURE WORK

•	Option of adding lines and various shapes can be added.
•	The colour selection for drawing using pencil can be increased.
•	An option of cropping an image can be added.
•	A feature of filling colour in a specified boundary can be added.
•	The UI can be made cleaner.
